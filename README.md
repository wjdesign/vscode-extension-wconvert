# wconvert  

This is the README for my practice extension "wconvert". Just only converting between dateTime String and timestamp, or generating the timestamp.

# Features  

## Generation timestamp  

use `Cmd+Shift+P` and searching keywords：`WConvert: Generate Timestamp` to find my command, inputing the datetime string you want.
